                <p>Born and raised on the north coast of NSW, with a mother of English decent and a father of Maori decent, I was surrounded by contrasting culture and lifestyles from an early age. I believe this is what has lead me to have such an interest in IT. With all aspects of IT allowing myself and others to connect to family and friends in a way that just wasn't possible even 15 years ago, the interconnectedness and future possibilities of the industry is what drives my passion for IT.</p>
                <p>As for an interesting fact, I snapped my colar bone getting towed by a dog on a RipStik and didn't realise for over two days.</p>
