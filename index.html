                    <h3 class="heading">About Me</h3>
                    <p>Born and raised on the north coast of NSW I’ve always had a passion for anything IT. Being surrounded by technology in all aspects of my childhood and life today, IT is an inescapable and integral piece of our society as a whole. From an Australian/Maori background, technology has been a major factor in staying connected with family, friends and culture across the world, and is the main reason I want to study IT. I haven’t had any further education past Year 12, however I hope this course can allow me to pursue a degree and eventually a career in IT.</p>
                    <p>As for a (not-so)interesting fact, I have a pet fish named Tails.</p>

                    <h3 class="heading">Interest in IT</h3>
                    <p>Playing video games as a kid and figuring out the different things I could do with a computer is what sparked my interest in IT, but learning simple C++ and python is what made me realise I want a career in IT. With the ability to do anything you can think of at your fingertips, and with new technology developing everyday, I believe the possibilities of the industry are endless and I’m excited to see what’s to come in the future.</p>
                    <p>I don’t have much experience working in IT, besides learning a bit of C++ and Python in my spare time, and I’m keen to see where this course takes me.</p>
                    <p>I chose to come to RMIT because of the flexible and self-paced online learning structure, as well as the good reputation and friendly staff.</p>
                    <p>As I’m just studying this course through OUA, I’m hoping it can open the door to studying a degree in IT, while also teaching me the foundations and core skills to pursue a career.</p>
