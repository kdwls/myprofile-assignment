                    <h3 class="heading">About Me</h3>
                    <p>Born and raised on the north coast of NSW I’ve always had a passion for anything IT. Being surrounded by technology in all aspects of my childhood and life today, IT is an inescapable and integral piece of our society as a whole. From an Australian/Maori background, technology has been a major factor in staying connected with family, friends and culture across the world, and is the main reason I want to study IT. I haven’t had any further education past Year 12, however I hope this course can allow me to pursue a degree and eventually a career in IT.</p>
                    <p>As for a (not-so)interesting fact, I have a pet fish named Tails.</p>

                    <h3 class="heading">Interest in IT</h3>
                    <p>Playing video games as a kid and figuring out the different things I could do with a computer is what sparked my interest in IT, but learning simple C++ and python is what made me realise I want a career in IT. With the ability to do anything you can think of at your fingertips, and with new technology developing everyday, I believe the possibilities of the industry are endless and I’m excited to see what’s to come in the future.</p>
                    <p>I don’t have much experience working in IT, besides learning a bit of C++ and Python in my spare time, and I’m keen to see where this course takes me.</p>
                    <p>I chose to come to RMIT because of the flexible and self-paced online learning structure, as well as the good reputation and friendly staff.</p>
                    <p>As I’m just studying this course through OUA, I’m hoping it can open the door to studying a degree in IT, while also teaching me the foundations and core skills to pursue a career.</p>

                    <img src="img/job.jpeg" alt="Job" id="job-ad">
                    <p>This role involves full stack development using client-side technology, C#, multiple frameworks and tools. It includes analysis, design and production of high quality software for an online gambling platform. With offices located internationally the opportunity to travel, as well as the actual job, this job is very appealing.</p>
                    <p>A minimum of 2-5 years software development, a minimum 3 year relevant qualification or a relevant 1 year certification and at lease 2 years software development experience is required before applying. Experience in clients such as Polymer/Lit, JavaScript, HTML and tools such as Git, Azure Dev Ops and SonarQube is also preferred and highly regarded.</p>
                    <p>Although my skills and qualifications don’t match the job description at this point in time, other than basic HTML, I’m hopeful by the end of my degree I’ll have the skills and certifications to pursue this job. Through practice and implementation of the aforementioned clients and tools throughout my study at RMIT, both in personal projects and class assignments, I believe this is possible.</p>
